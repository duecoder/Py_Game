# Py_Game
While learning about Python, I had an ideia of creating a simple game, to train and execute somethings that I've learned in python so far. 

In this project/game, there are 3 people with some info: job, birth month, and favorite food. 
These info are not shown, only some tips about them.

Then, you have to guess the right answers, but with only a few chances.

It's really really simple, but i'm really proud of it :-)
